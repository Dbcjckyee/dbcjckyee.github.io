  <h1>About Justin Yee</h1>
<p>My name is Justin, and I am a native San Franciscan. I've decided to do Dev Bootcamp because I'd like to do something more interesting with my life. My educaitonal background is in history, with my work background being in nonprofits and startups. I'm just hoping to build a lot of cool stuff and learn some new things. I spend most of my free time playing and studying card games. Interesting things about me include: I enjoy competitive eating, prefer to walk everywhere, and rely way, way too much on luck and intuition on a day-to-day basis.</p>

  <h1>Feedback</h1>

      At the start of phase 0, I felt that pairing was not the most natural between me and others. There was some inconsistency with my partners in that some of them had read the material while others went into the challenge blind. Now that it is in phase 2, I feel that the skill level of my partners has evened out. More people seem prepared when dealing with challenges and are very willing to contribute to the code and voice their thoughts. I think the most rewarding thing for me when partnering is being able to explain my thought process. Doing this shows that I understand the material and can put concepts into my own words.As a nice side effect, the partner I'm working with hopefully would get a better understanding of the concept(s).

      For my more recent feedback, it does not very ASK. A number of them are a few sentences long and mention that the people liked to work with me. I think that early on, I was a lot more reckless when coding. I tend to brute force solve problems I encounter on a daily basis, and doing things like pseudocode is a bit counterintuitive for me. I much prefer to jam an answer and see the result, but this method does not always work for other people. I think that I need to be a lot more patient when working with others, especially if the other person is struggling with the material. I also hope to improve my pseudocode skills, as pseudocode is the building block from which full code is started.

      For me, feedback is pretty hard to write since I like to think a lot about what occurred during a session. It can be a bit challenging to sum up my thoughts or hit all the notes in ASK. Another hard thing for me about writing feedback is trying to remain positive. It's easy to provide negative feedback, and trying to frame issues in a positive light can be a bit time-consuming.

      I'm still a bit neutral on whether pairing and feedback are great methods for learning. I haven't had that one really good or really bad experience that would set the tone for future encounters. All I can really do is wait and see. I am more exciting about peer pairing in person though, since I think that I communicate better face-to-face.

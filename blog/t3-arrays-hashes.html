  <h1>Hashes and Arrays</h1>

      In this post, we will learn the differences between hashes and arrays. For starters, we can look over some of their similarities. These are both containers that hold values. Imagine having a digital asset where you can put all sorts of words and numbers. You can change an array into a hash and vice versa. Lastly, you can retrieve values within hashes and arrays.
      </p>
      <p>
      Arrays in particular are ordered as a list of things. Each value has a specific place in an arrays, and each place can hold only one value. To access a value in an array, users need to call on the array's place. Arrays are represented by [].
      </p>
      <p>
        Hashes are more complex than arrays. They have two elements: keys and values. Users can call on a key to fetch its value, as all the values are ordered by their keys. The location of a key is irrelevant to the user. Hashes are represented by {}.

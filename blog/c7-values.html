  <h1>Values</h1>

       Values: willpower: 5, knowledge: 4, autonomy: 3, cooperation: 4, truth: 5, meaningful work: 3, privacy: 4.
    </p>

      I think willpower is one of my highest values because I take pride in what I accomplish. I've gone through some rough patches in my life and have been able to weather the storm so to speak through sheer determination. I just need to be able to move forward to accomplish what I want.

      One of the last things someone asked me for advice on involved building up a community in the South Bay. Community revolves a lot around meaningful work and cooperation, and I tried to suggest ways to build up said community. For instance, I tried to suggest connections, event ideas, and ways to network with other people. I guess knowledge would come into play here as well since I tried to rely on my mental rolodex of names and places.

      I think that self affirmation can be helpful when confronting hardships. It helps you recenter yourself so that you can focus on the tasks at hand. I think that having values gives me a purpose since it shows that I've learned something after all these years. Values are grown over time and not just developed over night. I guess reaffirming values could help when dealing with the stereotype threat. Undergoing stereotype threat is another challenge, and values that have survived for years likely have gone under tribulations. If you have survived to this point, you can definitely move forward.
    </p>

      I think that one other exercise for assuaging discouragement would be talking with other people in your cohort. They will likely be in similar situations, and it always help to bond with others. By working together, people can accomplish a lot of great things. This also helps to build out empathy and make people feel a lot more invested.

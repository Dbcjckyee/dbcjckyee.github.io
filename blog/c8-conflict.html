  <h1>Conflict</h1>
  <h4>9/18/15</h4>

  <section>
    <p>
       Having done volunteer work with a nonprofit, I found conflict to be quite commonplace since there are often many different voices and viewpoints in the room at any given point. I worked with diverse group, many of whom were very vocal and passionate about their beliefs. One of the tamer conflicts I've experienced had to do with running an event. It was one of my duties to maintain the website for our event, and our Executive Director looked at it and had a conniption over some grammatical errors. He asked why there were errors there, questioned people at fault, and just overall had a negative presence. It was a very stressful situation, as this was for our annual fundraiser, an event that would host about 500 people.

      One of the primary emotions I felt was disrespect. It is a volunteer organization with people who volunteer their time outside of work and their busy lives. This was an extremely busy time, and I felt that done was better than perfect. As a result, I couldn't call in our copy editor and wait for the 1-2 week lead time. The ED is supposed to be the face of an organization, someone who represents the best, and I just sort of lost respect.

      I didn't really address the conflict directly afterwards; I went through the website to clean everything up and just left things unsaid. I don't think that the grammar errors on the site had much of an effect on our audience, but it always helps to look professional. I think I would have gone back and been more open about how I felt. I think I should have brought it up in a meeting and describe how people such as myself felt. Going forward, it would have helped the ED cope with future similar scenarios that could prove mentally taxing. The anger in the conflict was never really resolved, but good communication could have really been great here.

      My main takeaway from the situation is learning to respect others, expecially if they are hardworking and passionate. Doing volunteer work invovles a lot of fruits of labor and passion, and introducing conflict items can turn people away quickly. I would definitely like to use my communications skills going forth more and not let sleeping dogs lie. I think it's important to bring things up so that people are always on the same page. But it's a bit hard for me since I can be seen as a bit callous or unfeeling. I think I need to develop a nice medium or something; it's hard to walk between being open and being too blunt.

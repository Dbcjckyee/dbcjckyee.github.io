  <h1>Thinking Styles</h1>
  <h4>7/26/15</h4>

    <p>
      My personal thinking style is concrete sequential. I just like looking at a thing and taking it at face value. I like working with established factors and can be a bit uncertain when engaging with the unknown. DBC appeals to me since it has been around for a while and has a very structued style of teaching that's gone through multiple interations. All the directions are laid out in bare, so that's compatible with me.

        I think the biggest struggle so far is doing pair programming. I'm still learning to be a good communicator and need to be better at it. I'm also a bit anxious about not knowing how to do a certain thing, and it can come off as nerves sometimes. Concrete sequential thinkers are said to have some problems working in groups, so it may be involved here. I need to be more open to ambiguity instead of throwing out a tried and true solution to things. Also, I need to relax more and build a report with my partner instead of just heading right into the work.
    </p>
    <p>
        With regards to a growth vs. fixed mindset, I will need to try to adapt other ways of thinking to succeed. It's ok and never too late to change, and I'm going to make this my goal.

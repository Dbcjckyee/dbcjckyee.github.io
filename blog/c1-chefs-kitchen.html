      My take on the video is that DBC is all about collaborative learning. People are going to learn a ton in a short period of time, and success comes from attitude. It was interesting to hear that there's nervousness on both sides for teachers and students. I think it's important for me to keep an open mind and trust the DBC process. DBC has been around for a while and has continued to hone its style of teaching.

        I like how the video reinforces how safe DBC is as an environment. There is a lot of risk involved, but it seems like people are really supportive of one another. Everything is really new and exciting, and I can't wait to start.

        Other than that, I have no idea what to really expect. I guess it's all about the journey. I can't expect to build an entire app now, but at some point, all the little things will add up for me.

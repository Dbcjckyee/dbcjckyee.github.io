  <h1>Enumerables</h1>

    <p>
       Enumerable methods in Ruby exist to help you move through values in data sets one at a time. One enumerable method out there is called map. The basic function of map involves taking an array of items and putting out a new array that contains modifications to some or each item. For instance, you can have an array of integers [1,2,3,4,5] and multiply each integer by a constant.
      </p>
      <p>
      Obvously, this saves a lot of time if you need to make a lot of changes to array values. Instead of going array[0] += 1, array[1] += 1, and so forth, all you need to do is run the map method. Similarly, map can help add characters to strings in arrays.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here are a couple of examples:
        <br><br>
        [10,20,30,40].map {|x| x * 10}
        <br>
        ["I", "am", "having", "a", "great", "day"].map {|x| x += "!"}
        <br>
        <br>
        What do you think these return?
      </p>
      <p>
      I really like map because it just saves me a lot of time. So far, I've pretty much mapped out characters to strings and value to numbers. It's a pretty powerful tool if you think that you can literally modify an array with a million values with a single line of code. I bet there are even stronger, more practical applications out there, but I am still just starting out with my little 1s and 0s.

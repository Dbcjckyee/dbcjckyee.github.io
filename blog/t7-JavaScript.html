  <h1>Ruby and Javascript Differences</h1>
  <h4>9/10/2015</h4>

  <section>

    <p>
       Having looked through Google a bit on differences between Ruby hashes and JS objects, I've found a couple of different things between the two. However, they do seem more similar than different. For instance, they are defined by their curly brackets, operate in paired keys/values, can pull up information based on supplied keys, support nested data structures, and hold data in (somewhat) unordered lists.
      </p>
     <p>
      For hashes, their keys can generally by any type of object. Integers, strings, and symbols--you can attach a value to any of these items. JS objects on the other hand usually rely on strings for their keys. For instance, you can't attach a string value to an integer. In this, Ruby is slightly more flexible with hashes than JS is with objects.
      </p>

      <p>
        Calling a value within a hash is also different from calling a value within an object. JS objects make values their properties. For instance, if you key name to "Steve" for an object called person, you can call the object's property by referring to person.name. In Ruby, you call hash values by referring to their keys in [] brackets. For instance, in hash objects with key "a" and value letter, you would call letter by stating objects["a"].

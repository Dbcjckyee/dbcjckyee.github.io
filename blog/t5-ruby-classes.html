    <p>
       Classes in Ruby are quite powerful because they allow people to create objects similar to one another that inherit details from a master class. For instance, if you need to create a set of repeated objects in Ruby, you can create a class for them and set individual details when each one is created. This ultimately helps users save time and keep all of their code organized. Classes are used only when there are multiple similar objects at stake. If you are creating a relatively unique object, classes will not be needed.
      </p>
      <p>
      One of the cool features of classes is its instance variables. These variables can be accessed from outside the class by the user/Ruby, allowing for a wider range of communication and interfunctionality. For instance, you can call a method with a class instance as the argument, and the method would have access to the class's instance variables.This is another way to save time and streamline coding practices.
      </p>
      <p>
      An example class in Ruby would be movie. When a user creates a movie, the movie will need to have a number of its instance variables defined, such as @director, @date, and @genre. At any point, the user can call on the movie's name, along with its instance variable to pull up the instance variable's information.You can also add instance methods to the movie class, allowing users to interact with it in more ways. For instance, if you give it a method called 'details,' it could print out all of its instance variables to the console.

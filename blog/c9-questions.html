       When asking questions, I think that my main flaw is that I tend to ask things that may not be relevant to everyone in a general crowd setting. For instance, I would ask about a specific detail that would affect maybe 20% of a crowd in front of everyone. Some people can see this as a waste of time, as these more targeted questions can be asked to specific people at a later point. I guess one of my fears is forgetting to ask said question at a later point, so I feel compelled to ask right away. This is easy to fix, as I just need to be more patient with others and learn to budget my time better.

      For the questions themselves, I like to thing that I ask good ones. During my coding education, I've taken the habit of providing hard examples to the people I work with. I think that this helps eliminate a lot of ambiguity, since the answering person has a frame of reference from where I come. I notice that this is a common practice on Stack Overflow, as the place has lots and lots of sample code in both answers and questions. The Google+ for DBC also has a lot of sample code that people float towards one another.

  One of the things that I have trained myself to do is to use Google before asking another person. I find that 90% of the time, Google can provide something suitable. I usually ask other people if my problem is more nuanced. Google is quite good at providing answers to general questions, but more focused ones can be a bit more elusive. The type of people I ask tend to have a lot more programming experience than I do. I think that because they are more experienced, they can devote less time to me, thereby freeing both of us up. If I ask someone inexperienced, we might spend a lot of time on something rather simple. I think that this will be a delicate line to walk at DBC.

    <p>
    I didn't see too many unanswered questions in both Stack Overflow and G+. People in the DBC community were usually quick to respond to one another, and whenever I used Google and Stack Overflow, I tended to get the answers I wanted. The Stack Overflow pages that made my eyes glaze over typically contained content that was way over my head. The pages I was able to follow though proved helpful enough.

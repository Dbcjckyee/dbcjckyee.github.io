  <h1>Tech problems</h1>

      One of the biggest issues in tech currently is diversity. Some of the biggest companies in the industry are understaffed for women and certain minorities. While Asians are well represented in tech, it's hard to find ones who are a part of leadership teams. For some underrepresented minorities who have made it in the tech field, it can be difficult for them to feel included since their peers are so few. The one incident that shocks me to this day happened at Kixeye, where one African American employee faced blatant racism from his peers and superiors on a daily basis.

        I think that this problem can be addressed from a number of different angles. You could start at the talent pipeline for one. It would be helpful for companies to donate their time to underrpresented minorities so that they can get them excited about science and math. There are also coding schools out there designed specifically for women. Tech teams can also build out diversity initiatives and actively try to recruit underrpresented minorities.

        I also think that tech companies need to take direct actions. For instance, they can hire actual HR teams and implement policies that would protect certain groups of people. Companies can compare salaries between different groups of people and start to equalize the figures. Leadership teams can take that extra effort to promote certain minorities. Lastly, these companies need to be accountable for any diversity-related initiatives.
    </p>

        One last idea for improving diversity would involve teaching empathy to people. A lot of people prefer to gather around those who are most like them and may not have many friends outside their race. This can cause people to act ignorantly around people they are unfamiliar with. It's a tough thing to enact, given how cities and suburbs across the country are paved along socioeconomic lines.

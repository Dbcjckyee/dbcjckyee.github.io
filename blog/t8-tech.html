    <p>
       Ruby on Rails is a web development framework that is open source and written, aptly enough, in Ruby. Users can write different web applications with it and perform a number of routine development-related tasks. Rails seems to be updated constantly, as its creators often integrate new development technologies into it. Because of its open source nature, Ruby and Rails receive contributions from a large online commuity and even have conferences that discuss the development of the language.
      </p>
     <p>
      At the start of a Ruby application, the program can build out an empty app framework and host it on an internal server. The program also creates folders and files that users can add and edit. For instance, users can add in their own HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code to their apps and start to run them from the background. Rails contains a number of different software packages and can ultimately be called an application programming interface. Users can build sites rather quickly by enlisting various RubyGems and collaborate with others online.
      </p>

      <p>
      One of Rails' key advantages is that a lot of the framework is streamlined. Whenever Rails undergoes an update, the Ruby development team enforces processes so that they adhere to the "Rails way." There is some debate between streamlining Rails development and allowing developers to be more creative in their coding and implementations. One clear advantage of a streamlined approach is that developers can easily recognize coding patterns and contribute quickly. This fosters agile, speedy app development. There's always a best possible solution to a program, which can contrast with problems seen in more open-ended languages.
      </p>

      <p>
      One other side effect of Rails' streamlined nature is that it focuses on convention over configurations. Users do not need to spend time configuring individual files in their apps and can instead focus on building their conventions. Again, this prevents some open-endness in favor of simplification.
      </p>

      <p>
        Lastly, Rails supports automated testing through user-defined tests. Instead of having users manually test each and every app feature, Rails supports small test programs that can do this type of work. As a result, Rails developers adhere to test-driven development for the apps they build. Tests come before the actual code itself and allow developers to envison what is exactly needed in an app. Each time a new feature needs finalization, the users can run their tests to ensure that nothing breaks after the changes.

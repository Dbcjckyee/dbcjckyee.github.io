  When building out stylesheets and HTML code, it's important to think of items in terms of blocks. You can then arrange these blocks' locations as you like through good CSS design. The blocks additionally have different layers, each of which can be directly modified.
    </p>
    <p>
  The outermost layer in a block is called the margin. The margin dictates how much blank space there is between one block and another. Margins also help with horizontal placement. You can have a block with a left margin go wide so that it can push its contents to the right hand side of the page.
    </p>
    <p>
  The second outermost layer in a block is called a border. Borders are pretty straight forward since everyone knows what a border is. This border is a line that wraps directly around the block. You can set the border's style (dashed, solid), color, and length in your stylesheet. Lastly, borders are invisible by default but always function in the backgrond.
    </p>
    <p>
  The third layer in a block is called padding. This piece lies between the border and content and can add more space around the content to give it room to breathe. Some people use large padding to create cool, shiny buttons.

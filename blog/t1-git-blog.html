Version control is very important because it allows you to revert to a stable build in case you mess up your code. Without version control, users would have to manually undo their code. This would be extremely time consuming. Version control also helps track coding changes. Each time a new version comes out, users can mark the changes they've made through notes. Lastly, version control provides backup space for users. If a person loses a laptop with Git, that person can go through GitHub to head right back into coding.

Git keeps track of code through save states called commits. Good coders should commit often, as problems can arrive often and quickly get out of hand. As coders do their commits, they can leave notes on what is new in their commits. This helps people who are trying to debug code. Lastly, each commit carries a string key. Users can do 'git diff [string1] [string2]' to see the differences between two commits.

        GitHub is important to use because it allows multiple users to work on the same project simultaneously in a collaborative environment. Coders can work locally, push their code to the cloud, and fetch new code updates as they come through. Users can additionally invite outsiders to look and code and receive help and feedback. Lastly, GitHub acts as a portfolio of sorts where you can show off your various projects.

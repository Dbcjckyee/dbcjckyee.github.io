  <h1>Stereotype Threat</h1>
  <h4>9/5/15</h4>

  <section>
    <p>
      The stereotype threat is a psychological condition that compels people to adhere to their negative social/racial/etc. stereotypes. For instance, if someone is of a perceived unintelligent background, that person will psychologically suffer for it by underperforming and feeling weighted down by negative energy. The stereotype threat manifests itself in the forms of stress, low self esteem, and hopelessness.

      For most of my life, I have tried to live outside the stereotype threat by conforming to my own standards. There are a lot of negative stereotypes that surround Asian males in terms of social demeanor, and I usually don't care about that sort of stuff. I can be a bit abrasive and loud at times, and if someone tries to provoke me using stereotype-loaded language, I've been known to go off. I guess that I've always liked the ideal of being one's own self, not really caring what others think about you. Sometimes, I actively go against my perceived stereotypes in social settings to throw people off because that can be fun. From an educational background, I also try to veer off from the stereotype threat. Having a background in humanities, I still take the time to brush up on topics such as science and (now) web development.

      I can imagine that some people feel weighted down by stereotypes because they are more comfortable going with the flow than actively trying to change perceptions. It's easier to meet one's expectations than to surpass them, especially if these expectations are coming from all different parts of society. Not everyone can set one's mind at ease and tell society off, as that's really hard to do when you are growing around expectations for over a couple of decades.

      I try my best to give people a blank slate when meeting them by not associating them with any perceived prejudices. It's hard to do given the amount of social stimulation out there, but it's a process. I'll definitely try my best at DBC to continue this. It's just all about keeping an open mind. I think it's also important to make people feel welcome, especially in such a vulnerable space in which people are feeling a ton of pressure to learn. By reducing as much social risk (or stress) as possible, everyone should be a lot better off as a whole. Additionally, I think I can help out by emphasizing the fun in learning. Stereotype threats manifest themselves within pressure-filled situations, and if we can focus on having fun, then the stress should leave the room. Focusing not on stereotypical roles and instead on something else is one of the best ways to combat the stereotype threat.
